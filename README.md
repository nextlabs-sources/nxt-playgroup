### Recommended reading ###

It is highly recommended that you read [Scott Chacon's book to learn Git](http://git-scm.com/book) – it is available as a [downloadable pdf](https://progit2.s3.amazonaws.com/en/2015-04-01-b8352/progit-en.437.pdf) as well.

* Read all of it, except maybe the part about setting up a Git server – but the first three chapters are essential for getting a basic understanding of how to work with Git
